I am a software engineer and general nerd about anything related to computers or electronics... and this is my space on the World Wide Web! I go by the username *The BombSquad* in most places online.

Here, you'll find assorted ramblings about topics such as vintage computers, reverse engineering, video game modding, programming, and more. 

#### Social Media
I don't use traditional social media platforms often, but you can still find me in these places:
* Blog: [bombsquad.dev](https://bombsquad.dev)
* BlueSky: [@bombsquad.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/bombsquad.dev)
* Discord: @thebombsquad

#### Other Places
* GitHub: [TheBombSquad](https://github.com/TheBombSquad)
* GitLab: [@TheBombSquad](https://gitlab.com/TheBombSquad)

#### This Site

This site was built using my own static site generator written in Rust! I used `askama` for template generation, and `markdown` / `gray_matter` for Markdown parsing. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used for CSS styling.

This website is unfortunately not currently IE5 compatible. I'm working on that. 

Beyond that, I'm striving to keep this website as lightweight and accessible as possible, so don't expect any fancy JavaScript, tracking features, or anything like that. 

Why is it so orange? I like amber CRTs!
