I'm *The BombSquad*, and this is my personal website! (I'm just one person, 
despite the name!)

I am a professional software engineer, and general nerd about anything
related to computers or electronics. I have had the opportunity to work on
several wonderful games throughout my career, mostly focusing on performance and
memory optimization. I'm also an avid contributor to the Super Monkey Ball
modding community.

On this site, you'll find assorted ramblings about topics such as vintage 
computers, reverse engineering, video game modding, programming, and more. 
I'll try to post regularly, but I make no promises as to any sort of schedule!

#### This Site

I wrote the static site generator that built this website in Rust! I used the
library `askama` for HTML template generation, and the libraries `markdown` and
`gray_matter` for Markdown parsing. The source code for my generator is
available [on GitHub!](https://github.com/TheBombSquad/TheBombSquad.github.io)

I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for CSS/styling. The main font used is
[NEC APC3 8x16](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/font?nec_apc3_8x16), by `VileR`. 
I also use the [Terminus TTF](https://files.ax86.net/terminus-ttf/) font for code blocks.

I'm striving to keep this website fairly lightweight and accessible, so
don't expect any fancy JavaScript or tracking features.

What's with the amber color scheme, you might ask? I like amber CRTs!
I have actually written a few articles for this site on an 8086-compatible
portable that uses an amber CRT. More information about that hardware coming 
soon to this site! I find the lack of distractions associated with writing on older
hardware to be very helpful.
