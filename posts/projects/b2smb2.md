BlendToSMBStage2 is a Blender plugin that assists with the creation of custom Super Monkey Ball stages.
With this plugin, you can create a 3D model for your stage in Blender, map out item, goal, and starting
placements, and then export the model and stage configuration directly into Super Monkey Ball 2.
This plugin utilizes the custom level tools [SMB Workshop 2](https://gitlab.com/CraftedCart/smblevelworkshop2)
and [GxUtils](https://github.com/TheBombSquad/GxUtils) for generating stage configuration and model files compatible
with the original game. This plugin started as a re-write and port of CraftedCart's Blend2SMBStage plugin for Blender 2.7x
with extended functionality.
The original version of the plugin can be found [here.](https://gitlab.com/CraftedCart/BlendToSMBStage)

The latest version of CraftedCart's SMB Workshop 2 is built in, but can be separately downloaded [here.](https://craftedcart.gitlab.io/ws2web/#/download)

The latest version of GxModelViewer is also included, and can be downloaded [here.](https://github.com/TheBombSquad/GxUtils/releases/latest)

A guide to the usage of this tool, along with documentation in regards to Monkey Ball modding as a whole, can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/194QZxrimkjHEzSSMKbafs86PnmiYmFBZUnoaEnks4es/edit)
